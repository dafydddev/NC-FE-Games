# Northcoders House of Games Front End

## Introduction

Front-end for example board game review website. Uses:

* JavaScript
* Node (built using v18.14.1)
* React (built using v18.0.2)
* Axios (built using v1.4.0

The above versions can be considered the minimal supported versions. In practice, earlier versions may work, however I advise making sure that you are using at least the above to avoid issues.
