# Northcoders House of Games Front End

## Introduction

Front-end for example board game review website. Uses:

* JavaScript
* Node (built using v18.14.1)
* React (built using v18.0.2)
* Axios (built using v1.4.0)
* Vite (built using v4.3.9)

The above versions can be considered the minimal supported versions. In practice, earlier versions may work, however I advise making sure that you are using at least the above to avoid issues.

This server is hosted via [Netlify](https://render.com) and is available [https://nc-houseofgames.netlify.app/](https://nc-houseofgames.netlify.app/).

## Setup

After forking, you can install the Node modules using npm install. From there `npm run dev` should prompt Vite to create an instance of the front-end, which can be opened through the `localhost` server it should start.
